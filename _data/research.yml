To tackle its low power transfer efficiency between transmitter and receiver, which is the foremost obstacle of radio frequency (RF) based WPT, we have implemented high-efficiency microwave beam synthesizing with multiple antennas. Inevitable shaded area due to the various kinds of obstacles between transmitter and receiver has been solved by deploying reconfigurable metasurface near the shaded area. In the case that transmitter detects obstacle in the middle, energy beam from the transmitter would be steered to metasurface and then by converting the phase of incident electro-magnetic waves of each cell in metasurface, transmitted power can be focused to receiver as well. With proposed convergent power transfer algorithm that handles all hardware components at the same time, optimized power transfer efficiency can be achieved regardless of whether the obstacle detected or not."
